abstract = {The incidence of penile cancer varies from country to country, with the highest figures reported for countries in Africa, South America, and Asia and lowest in the United States and Europe. Causes of this variation are not clear, but they are thought to be related to human papillomavirus infection, smoking, lack of circumcision, chronic inflammation, and poor genital hygiene. Most penile tumors are squamous cell carcinomas, and a variegated spectrum of distinct morphologies is currently recognized. Each one of these subtypes has distinctive pathologic and clinical features. About half of penile carcinomas are usual squamous cell carcinomas, and the rest corresponds to verrucous, warty, basaloid, warty-basaloid, papillary, pseudohyperplastic, pseudoglandular, adenosquamous, sarcomatoid, and cuniculatum carcinomas. Previous studies have found a consistent association of tumor cell morphology and human papillomavirus presence in penile carcinomas. Those tumors composed of small- to intermediate-sized, basaloid ("blue") cells are often human papillomavirus positive, whereas human papillomavirus prevalence is lower in tumors showing large, keratinizing, maturing eosinophilic ("pink") cells. Human papillomavirus-related tumors affect younger patients, whereas human papillomavirus-unrelated tumors are seen in older patients with phimosis, lichen sclerosus, or squamous hyperplasia. This morphologic distinctiveness is also observed in penile intraepithelial neoplasia. The specific aim of this review is to provide a detailed discussion on the macroscopic and microscopic features of all major subtypes of penile cancer. We also discuss the role of pathologic features in the prognosis of penile cancer, the characteristics of penile precursor lesions, and the use of immunohistochemistry for the diagnosis of invasive and precursor lesions.},

abstract = {Histologic grade has been reported as an important pathologic parameter predictive of nodal metastases and outcome in patients with penile squamous cell carcinoma. There is no consensus about the criteria for grading and the proportion of anaplastic cells required to classify a tumor as high grade. The incidence and management of heterogeneous tumors (tumors harboring more than 1 histologic grade) are not well established. The purposes of this study were to present a grading model for penile cancer, to test the practicality of the system by comparing a visual ("naked-eye") estimation of the proportions of grades with a digitally guided measuring system and to determine the influence on nodal metastasis of the various proportions of grades. A total of 117 penectomy and circumcision specimens with bilateral inguinal lymph node dissections were studied and 62 heterogeneous tumors were identified (53\%). The following steps were taken: (1) design of a grading system model; (2) determination of proportions of histologic grades by naked-eye evaluation and by digital measurement; (3) evaluation of metastasis according to proportions of grades; (4) determination of the influence of site of grade 3 in nodal metastasis; (5) design of a Gleason-like scoring system; and (6) statistical evaluation. We designed a 3-tier grading system. Grade 1: well-differentiated cells, almost undistinguishable from normal squamous cells except for the presence of minimal basal/parabasal cell atypia. Grade 3: tumors predominantly composed of anaplastic cells. Grade 2: all tumors not fitting into criteria described for grade 1 or 3. A visual and digital-based (slides scanned and the corresponding areas measured with an image-editing software) proportions of grades were estimated and the metastatic rate between them were confronted using different proportions of grade 3. To evaluate the influence of site of grade 3 on nodal metastasis, we selected 20 heterogeneous tumors. We established 3 sites: superficial, at or within the main tumor and deep at front of invasion. There was no significant difference between the visual estimation and the digital measurement systems. Heterogeneous tumors comprised about half of penile squamous cell carcinomas. The majority of the heterogeneous tumors were composed of a combination of grades 2 and 3 (68\%). No statistical differences were noted in the incidence of nodal metastasis when comparing tumors with various proportions of anaplastic cells (P>0.10 in all cases). Metastatic rate was significantly more frequent in tumors harboring any proportion of grade 3 as compared with tumors without grade 3 (58\% vs. 14\%, P=0.04). Any proportion of grade 3 was equally associated with a significant risk of nodal metastasis. A Gleason-like system showed a correlation of higher scores and rate of nodal metastasis. No predictive advantage was found when comparing the Gleason-like model with the proposed 3-tier grading system. The proposed grading system emphasized both ends of the differentiation spectrum and was based on easily recognizable morphologic criteria. When histologically evaluating penile carcinomas, we recommend a careful search of areas of grade 3. Any focus of grade 3 should be sufficient to grade the neoplasm as a high-grade tumor.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: In this retrospective study we compared the clinical outcome of early vs delayed excision of lymph node metastases in patients with penile squamous cell carcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 40 patients with a T2-3 penile carcinoma with lymph node metastases were included in this study. All patients initially presented with bilateral impalpable lymph nodes. In 20 patients (50\%) metastases were removed when they became clinically apparent during meticulous followup (median interval 6 months, range 1 to 24). There were 20 patients (50\%) who underwent resection of inguinal metastases detected on dynamic sentinel node biopsy before they became palpable. The histopathological characteristics of the tumors and lymph nodes were reevaluated. RESULTS: The 2 populations were similar in terms of patient age, T-stage, pathological tumor grade, vascular invasion and infiltration depth. Disease specific 3-year survival of patients with positive lymph nodes detected during surveillance was 35\% and in those who underwent early resection, 84\% (log rank p = 0.0017). In multivariate analysis early resection of occult inguinal metastases detected on dynamic sentinel node biopsy was an independent prognostic factor for disease specific survival (p = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Early resection of lymph node metastases in patients with penile carcinoma improves survival.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the pathological features and clinical outcome in 75 patients with SCC of the penis, who were treated in participating urological centres between 1996 and 2005; the assessments of the local pathologists and the review pathologists were compared. RESULTS: There was conformity in tumour grade in 67\% and the assessment of tumour stage conformed in 84\%; the combination assessment of both grade and stage conformed in 56\%. CONCLUSION: Accurate histological subtyping by the surgical pathologist demands standardized guidelines, in particular for histological grading, which is crucial for clinical treatment, but shows significant interobserver variation.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The management of the regional lymph nodes in penile cancer patients, particularly when these lymph nodes are impalpable, remains controversial. Prophylactic bilateral inguinal lymphadenectomy is associated with high morbidity and is often unnecessary. However, there is no non-invasive or minimally invasive staging technique that can determine the lymph node status of penile cancer patients with 100\% accuracy. METHODS: We reviewed the current literature to examine the role of non-invasive and minimally invasive techniques for staging regional lymph nodes in penile cancer with particular reference to clinically impalpable disease. RESULTS: Cross-sectional imaging (un-enhanced CT and MRI) modalities have a role in the assessment of patients with palpable inguinal basins and in locating distant metastases, but are unreliable in staging impalpable regional lymph nodes. The spatial resolution of lymphotropic nanoparticle enhanced MRI (LNMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET)/CT are limited to several millimetres and so these modalities cannot reliably detect micro-metastases (<2 mm). Ultrasound (US) and fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) are indicated in staging palpable inguinal basins but are unreliable in isolation in the assessment of impalpable lymph nodes. They are, however, useful as an adjunct to dynamic sentinel lymph node biopsy (DSLNB) in lowering false-negative rates. CONCLUSIONS: While we await staging modalities that can equal the results of DSLNB with fewer disadvantages, histological staging in the form of DSLNB remains the best minimally invasive staging modality we can offer at risk patients presenting with clinically node negative groins.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Accurate tumor staging is essential in the management of malignancies. It provides a guide in selecting accurate treatment and gives an indication of prognosis based on the extent of disease. The current TNM classification for penile carcinoma has remained unchanged since 1987. In this article, we focus on several deficiencies of the current classification. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An analysis of the current literature regarding the current classification was done, focusing on known prognostic factors for survival. Furthermore, we discuss in detail the results from a recent analysis of more than 500 patients treated at our institute to evaluate the practical and prognostic value of the TNM-classification. RESULTS: We found that, using the current classification system, accurate clinical staging is often difficult, because the T and N categories are defined by structures that are not easily identified using physical examination or imaging. Furthermore, the prognostic stratification of the present staging system is not optimal and there is a substantial overlap in disease-specific survival between several categories. We give an overview of modifications that could improve clinical staging and prognostic ability. CONCLUSION: The current TNM classification for penile carcinoma has several shortcomings in terms of usability in clinical staging and prognostic value. With modifications clinical staging is facilitated, while the prognostic stratification of the classification is improved.},

abstract = {The staging lymph node dissection in patients with penile carcinoma is accompanied with a high morbidity. As many patients are free of nodal metastases the lymphoscintigraphic sentinel node biopsy is supposed to minimize perioperative morbidity in these patients. In the current study the accuracy of the lymphoscintigraphic sentinel node biopsy was verified against the gold standard of radical inguinal dissection. In particular, patients with enlarged lymph nodes have also been included since one half of these patients is known to have histologically negative lymph nodes. Between 2000 and 2004 fifteen patients with penile carcinoma were elected to undergo bilateral groin dissection, thus 30 inguinal areas have been dissected. Nine patients have had clinically palpable nodes. All patients underwent lymphoscintigraphy after injection of Tc99-nanocolloid subcutaneously into the peritumoral area. Intraoperatively the sentinel nodes were identified with the aid of a gamma ray detection probe and excised. Afterwards a standard groin dissection was performed and the different lymph nodes were histopathologically assessed separately. In all patients lymph nodes with high radioactivity uptake were detected bilaterally. In 10 out of 30 inguinal areas histopathologically positive lymph nodes were present. In four of them the sentinel node was positive for tumor but in six dissection areas lymph node metastases were found despite a negative sentinel node. These patients had clinically palpable lymph nodes in their histologically positive inguinal regions. If no palpable nodes were present dynamic sentinel biopsy detected the positive nodes. The current study showed that dynamic sentinel node biopsy in patients with clinically suspicious lymph nodes is of low value for detection of lymphatic spread in penile cancer. Therefore the gold standard in these patients remains the radical groin dissection. However, dynamic sentinel node biospy is still a promising strategy to identify lymphatic spreading in clinically N0 patients and therefore to prevent unnecessary groin dissection.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: We prospectively validated the association of local tumor stage and grade as a predictive factor for occult lymph node micrometastasis in patients with penile carcinoma and clinically negative lymph nodes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a retrospective study of 66 patients we demonstrated the predictive value of the association of local tumor stage and grade for occult micrometastasis, identifying 3 risk groups. A therapy strategy was designed according to these risk groups. A total of 37 consecutive patients were included in a prospective study in which the same criteria for risk group allocation and the same therapeutic recommendations were used as in the retrospective study. RESULTS: In the prospective study we noted positive lymph nodes in 11\% of stage T1, 63\% of stages T2-3, 15\% of grade 1, 67\% of grade 2 and 75\% of grade 3 cases. The incidence of positive nodes was 0\% in the low, 83.3\% in the high and 33.3\% in the intermediate risk group. These rates were similar to those in the retrospective study with no significant difference. CONCLUSIONS: The predictive value of the association of local tumor stage and grade for occult lymph node micrometastasis was validated in a prospective study. This factor allows the differentiation of 3 risk groups of patients with high reliability in the low and high risk groups. However, other prognostic factors are needed in the intermediate risk group to improve the prediction of lymph node involvement.},

abstract = {Sarcomatoid carcinomas are uncommon, high-grade tumors, predominantly composed of spindle cells. Only a few cases arising in the penis have been reported. The aim of this study is to better define the clinicopathologic features of this neoplasm. A total of 400 cases of squamous cell carcinoma of the penis were reviewed from which 15 sarcomatoid carcinomas (4\%) were identified. Clinical and pathologic features were evaluated in all cases. Immunohistochemical studies for expression of AE1/AE3, Cam 5.2, 34betaE12, EMA, vimentin, muscle specific actin, smooth muscle actin, desmin, S-100, p63, and p53 and in situ hybridization studies for HPV were performed in 5 cases. Information about lymph node status was available in 9 cases, and follow-up in 5 cases. The mean age was 59 years, and mean tumor size was 5 cm. Grossly, most tumors were large, polypoid, and ulcerated masses frequently affecting the glans (93\%) and deeply invading corpora cavernosa (80\%) and skin. Microscopically, the lesions were predominantly composed of atypical spindle cells disposed in interlacing fascicles, resembling fibrosarcoma or leiomyosarcoma, sometimes admixed with pleomorphic giant cells mimicking malignant fibrous histiocytoma. One case was predominantly composed of myxoid areas. Less frequent and focal patterns were pseudoangiomatous and epithelioid. Mitotic figures were numerous, and necrosis was prominent. Foci of heterologous differentiation toward bone (osteosarcomatous component) were present in 1 case. Four cases showed a minor mixed component of usual, papillary, verrucous, and basaloid carcinoma. Intrapenile metastasis ("satellitosis") was present in 4 tumors. One of the cases was multicentric with a separate independent focus of well-differentiated carcinoma with pseudohyperplastic features. Associated low- and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions were noted in 73\% of the cases. Immunohistochemical studies and HPV in situ hybridization were done in 5 cases. The spindle cells were diffusely positive for vimentin and p53 and showed at least intermediate expression of 34betaE12 and p63 in all cases. EMA and AE1/AE3 were focally positive in 60\% of the cases, and Cam 5.2 was focally positive in 1 case. Tumor cells failed to express muscle specific actin, smooth muscle actin, desmin, and S-100. HPV in situ hybridization was negative in all cases. Inguinal metastases were present in 89\% of the cases. Two of five patients with adequate follow-up died of disease within 8 months of the diagnoses. In conclusion, penile sarcomatoid carcinomas are unusual, large, and aggressive tumors usually associated with lymph node metastasis and poor outcome. Differential diagnoses include sarcoma and melanoma. Cytokeratin 34betaE12 and p63 appear to be the more specific and sensitive markers to categorize these tumors as epithelial. Diffuse immunoreactivity for p53, compared with a more basal and focal reactivity in differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, may be indicative of a late mutation in the natural progression of the disease.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The aim of this review was to identify prognostic pathologic factors which are independent from other clinical or molecular variables. METHODS: We reviewed the literature on morphological prognostic factors emphasizing our personal experience. RESULTS: We found that for a proper evaluation of prognostic factors a familiarity with penile complex anatomy is required. A biopsy of the primary tumor is not useful for a complete evaluation of prognostic factors other than malignancy and a resected specimen should be utilized. Penile carcinomas have a fairly predictable pattern of local, regional and systemic spread. Pathologic factors affecting patients outcome are multiple but it is difficult from the available studies using heterogeneous pathologic methodologies, different therapeutic approaches and ecologically variable patient populations to ascertain the independent validity of these factors. Invasion of perineural spaces by tumor, lymphatic-venous embolization and histological grade appear to be the most important pathologic predictors of nodal spread and cancer mortality. Other commonly cited factors influencing prognosis are tumor depth or thickness, anatomical site and size of the primary tumor, patterns of growth, irregular front of invasion, pathologic subtypes of the SCC, positive margins of resection and urethral invasion. A combination of two factors, histological grade and depth has been reported as significant predictor of cancer regional spread. After a preselection of significant factors, nomograms have been constructed to collectively evaluate the predictive power of various clinical and pathological indicators. CONCLUSIONS: Among various factors perineurial invasion, vascular invasion and high histological grade appear to be the most important adverse pathological prognostic factors.},

abstract = {Objectives: Dynamic sentinel node biopsy (DSNB) has been performed at our department since 1994 to assess status of inguinal lymph nodes of clinically node-negative (cN0) patients with penile carcinoma. Over time, several modifications were made to reduce the false-negative rate and thus increase sensitivity. We compared the false-negative and complication rates of the current procedure, as performed at our institute since 2001, with the prior procedures. Materials and methods: The patients who underwent DSNB for penile carcinoma in the period from 1994 until July 2004 were divided into two cohorts: cohort A: patients treated from 1994 until 2001; cohort B: patients treated from 2001 until 2004. Cohort A consisted of 92 patients, in whom 157 groins were explored. Cohort B consisted of 58 patients, with a total of 105 explored groins. Medians for follow-up in cohorts A and B were 83 (range: 24-130) and 30 (range: 24-49) mo, respectively. The false-negative and complication rates were determined in both cohorts. Results: In cohort A, 21 of 157 explored groins contained tumour-positive sentinel nodes, and five false-negative procedures were encountered, resulting in a false-negative rate of 19.2\%. In cohort B, 20 of 105 explored groins contained tumour-positive sentinel nodes, and one procedure was false-negative. The false-negative rate was 4.8\%. The rate of complications dropped from 10.2\% in cohort A to 5.7\% in cohort B. All complications were minor and transient. Conclusions: The false-negative and complication rates of DSNB have decreased since the procedure was modified. The current procedure has false-negative and complication rates of 4.8\% and 5.7\%, respectively. DSNB has matured into a reliable and safe method for assessing status of lymph nodes in cN0 penile carcinoma patients. © 2007 European Association of Urology.},

abstract = {We are reporting a peculiar variant of penile squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) characterized by its peculiar deeply penetrating and burrowing pattern of growth. This low grade, verruciform penile neoplasm is similar to the plantar epithelioma cuniculatum originally described by Ayrd in 1954. Clinical and pathologic features of 7 patients are presented. There were 7 partial penectomies and 4 bilateral inguinal node dissections. The mean patient's age was 77 years. Grossly, the tumors were white to gray, exo-endophytic, and papillomatous with a cobblestone or spiky appearance. All cases affected the glans and extended to coronal sulcus and foreskin (average size was 6.3 cm). The hallmark of the lesion was noted on cut surface where there were deep tumoral invaginations forming irregular, narrow, and elongated neoplastic sinus tracts connecting the surface of the neoplasm to deep anatomic structures. The neoplasm invaded through lamina propria and corpus spongiosum and grew along the loose connective tissue of Buck fascia to involve the tunica albuginea and corpora cavernosa (average depth was 32 mm). Deeply invasive keratin filled cysts or crypts, on serial sections, showed to be connected to the surface tumor. Fistulization to the skin was also noted. Microscopically, the lesions corresponded to well-differentiated carcinomas with bulbous front of invasion. There were focal areas of higher histologic grade and more infiltrative and jagged borders in 4 cases. Inguinal nodes were negative in 4 patients in which groin dissection was performed. Carcinoma cuniculatum is a variant of penile SCC with distinctive growth pattern and should be distinguished from other verruciform tumors such as the verrucous, papillary, and warty carcinomas. Unlike most subtypes of penile SCCs and despite the deep invasion, none of the tumors showed groin or systemic dissemination at time of diagnosis.},

abstract = {Purpose: We determined whether histological factors of primary penile squamous cell carcinoma could predict the risk of regional lymph node metastasis. Materials and Methods: The clinical records of 72 consecutive Chinese patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the penis were analyzed retrospectively. Of the patients 58 underwent bilateral inguinal lymph node dissection, of whom 9 also underwent unilateral or bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection. Primary lesions were evaluated according to recently revised standards. The variables recorded were histopathological classification, histological grade, pathological tumor stage, invasion depth, vascular invasion, and the number and position of metastatic lymph nodes. Results: No patients with verrucous carcinoma had regional lymph node metastasis. However, 100\% of patients with basaloid, 33.3\% with warty and 30\% with typical squamous cell carcinoma had lymph node metastasis (p = 0.002). The rate of lymph node metastasis was 18.8\% in patients with pT1, as compared with 53.1\% in patients with pT2 or pT3 (p = 0.004). The mean depth of invasion was 9.3 (range 2 to 22) vs 3.2 mm (range 1 to 6) in patients with and without lymph node metastasis, respectively (p <0.001). Conclusions: Histopathological classification, pathological tumor stage and depth of invasion of the primary lesion are significant predictors of regional lymph node metastasis in Chinese patients with penile squamous cell carcinoma. Combining these predictors can be used to select patients who are the best candidates for regional lymphadenectomy. ?? 2006 American Urological Association.},

abstract = {A concern of surgical oncologists has been to find a method to select patients for groin dissection in penile carcinomas considering the high morbidity of this procedure. A promising methodology, in the identification of early metastatic foci by the sentinel lymph node technique (initiated in Paraguay in the 1970s), was found, using a static anatomic approach, to be associated with a recurrence rate of 30\%. Later, a dynamic method using radioactive tracers and peritumoral dye injection was introduced with an improvement in patients' outcome. Recurrences, however, remained high in most studies at a rate of about 15\% to 20\% except in few highly specialized centers with failure rates of 5\%. The technical sophistication, lack of multicenter reproduction, and cost of dynamic sentinel node biopsies preclude their routine implementation in developing countries and other approaches are necessary. Because histologic grade, depth of tumor infiltration, and perineural invasion (PNI) are considered among the most important pathologic prognostic parameters in penile cancer, we devised a Prognostic Index combining these 3 factors. In this study, we are evaluating the incidence of nodal metastasis according to the Prognostic Index score. Pathologic materials from 193 patients with penectomy/circumcision and bilateral groin dissections for invasive squamous cell carcinoma were analyzed. The Prognostic Index (ranging from 2 to 7) consisted in the addition of numerical values given to histologic grade (1 to 3), deepest anatomic level involved by cancer (1 to 3), and presence of PNI (0 or 1). Histologic grades were defined as follows: grade 1, carcinomas with minimal to no atypias; grade 3, tumors showing any proportion of anaplastic cells; and grade 2, the remainder tumors. The anatomic levels and their numerical values were: in glans, lamina propria, 1; corpus spongiosum, 2; and corpus cavernosum, 3. In foreskin they were: lamina propria, 1; dartos, 2; and skin, 3. PNI was evaluated as follows: absence of PNI, 0; presence of PNI, 1. Penile intraepithelial neoplasia (carcinoma in situ), or index 1, was excluded from the study. Mean follow-up obtained in all patients was of 81 months. The distribution of cases and rate of metastasis according to index scores were: 2 (1 case), no metastasis; 3 (17 cases), no metastasis; 4 (35 cases), 20\% of metastasis; 5 50 cases), 50\% of metastasis; 6 (47 cases), 66\% of metastasis; and 7 (43 cases), 79\% of metastasis. On logistic regression analysis evaluating various pathologic factors, Prognostic Index scores were found as the best predictors of inguinal node metastasis and patients' survival. Inguinal node dissections might not be necessary for patients with low indices (2 and 3). Nodal dissections might be formally indicated for high-grade indexes (5 to 7). Patients with index 4 should be individually assessed for nodal dissection. If sentinel node biopsy cannot be performed for various reasons the Prognostic Index might represent a useful pathologic guide to the clinicians in the often difficult decision to perform an inguinal dissection or not.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: We determine if histopathological factors of the primary penile tumor can stratify the risk of the development of inguinal lymph node metastases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical records of 48 consecutive patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the penis who underwent resection of the primary lesion and either inguinal lymph node dissection or were observed for signs of recurrence (median followup 59 months) were reviewed. Parameters examined included pathological tumor stage, quantified depth of invasion and tumor thickness, histological and nuclear grade, percentage of poorly differentiated cancer in the primary tumor, number of mitoses and presence or absence of vascular invasion. Variables were compared in 18 lymph node positive and 30 lymph node negative cases. RESULTS: Pathological tumor stage, vascular invasion and presence of greater than 50\% poorly differentiated cancer were the strongest predictors of nodal metastasis on univariate and multivariate regression analyses. None of 15 pT1 tumors exhibited vascular invasion or lymph node metastases. Of 33 patients with pT2 or greater tumors 21 (64\%) had vascular invasion and 18 (55\%) had metastases. Only 4 of 25 patients (15\%) with 50\% or less poorly differentiated cancer in the penile tumor had metastases compared with 14 of 23 patients (61\%) with greater than 50\% poorly differentiated cancer (p = 0.001). No other variables tested were significantly different among the patient cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Pathological stage of the penile tumor, vascular invasion and greater than 50\% poorly differentiated cancer were independent prognostic factors for inguinal lymph node metastasis. Prophylactic lymphadenectomy in compliant patients with pT1 lesions without vascular invasion and 50\% or less poorly differentiated cancer does not appear warranted.},

Materials and Methods: We studied 333 patients with homogeneous surgical treatment, including circumcision in 4, local excision in 2, partial penectomy in 194 and total penectomy in 133. Of the patients 153 also underwent bilateral groin dissection. Followup was 8 to 453 months (average 100). Results: The usual type of squamous cell carcinoma was noted in 65\% of cases. Higher histological grade, deeper anatomical infiltration, and vascular and perineural invasion were common findings in sarcomatoid, basaloid and adenosquamous carcinoma cases, correlating with a higher rate of nodal metastasis and mortality. These features were unusual in verrucous, papillary and warty carcinoma cases. Recurrence in 22\% of cases was common for the sarcomatoid, basaloid and adenosquamous types but was not noted for verrucous carcinoma. Locoregional relapse was more common in cases of usual, mixed, papillary and warty carcinoma, and systemic relapse was typical in sarcomatoid and basaloid carcinoma cases. The overall metastasis rate was 24\% and the 10-year survival rate was 82\%. The highest mortality rate was observed within the first 3 years of followup. High grade tumors were more common in penectomy cases and carcinoma exclusive of the foreskin had a better prognosis. The nodal metastasis risk groups were low-verrucous, papillary and warty, intermediate-usual and mixed, and high risk-sarcomatoid, basaloid and adenosquamous. Mortality risk groups were low-mixed, papillary and warty, intermediate-usual and basaloid, and high risk-sarcomatoid.

abstract = {Penile squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is considered a loco-regional disease with a fairly predictable pattern of progression. Widespread dissemination occurs in at least one-third of the patients. Local recurrence (defined as the presence of tumor after a primary treatment affecting any remainder tissue, including skin, erectile corpora, or urethra) present in up to 30\% of the patients increases the risk of regional inguinal and pelvic lymph nodes metastases. The aim of this study was to identify adverse pathologic prognostic factors in patients with recurrent tumors. Clinicopathologic features of 81 surgically treated patients (25 with recurrent and 56 with nonrecurrent SCC) were evaluated; 56 patients (19 with recurrent and 37 with nonrecurrent tumors) additionally received groin dissections. Follow-up (2 to 372 mo, mean of 71 mo) was obtained in all patients. Comparison of recurrent tumors at the time of the primary diagnosis and of recurrence showed that histologic subtype and grade were identical in 76\% of the cases and converted to a higher grade tumor in 24\% of the cases, especially, in patients treated with local excisions and circumcisions. Most of the recurrences (67\%) seemed at or before 12 months. Comparison of recurrent and nonrecurrent tumors showed that high grade tumors (basaloid and sarcomatoid) tended to be significantly associated with recurrent tumors, whereas low grade variants (papillary, warty and verrucous) were more frequent in the nonrecurrent group; recurrent tumors invaded into deeper anatomic levels than nonrecurrent tumors. The incidence of inguinal lymph node metastasis was higher in recurrent tumors (79\% vs. 49\%, P=0.0272). Cancer-specific survival was of 46\% versus 76\% at 3 years of follow-up in recurrent and nonrecurrent tumors, respectively. Patients with recurrent tumors had a median survival of 2.9 years; no major changes in survival were noted after 3 years of follow-up. Mortality was higher in the recurrent group (56\% vs. 29\%, P=0.0188); 80\% of patients with high-grade tumors (basaloid, sarcomatoid, and high grade usual or hybrid verrucous SCCs) died from penile cancer. Mortality in patients with usual SCC was higher in the recurrent group, but similar in basaloid and sarcomatoid SCCs. After 3 years there was no survival difference in patients with low-grade recurrent tumors; however, in the high grade recurrent group there was a progressive and gradual decrease in survival from 2 to 10 years (median survival of 2.5 y). In summary, histologic subtypes and grades of SCCs were similar in the majority of original and recurrent carcinomas. Inguinal metastasis and mortality were higher in recurrent than in nonrecurrent carcinomas. Basaloid, sarcomatoid, and mixed usual-verrucous variants and invasion of corpora cavernosa or preputial skin were significant adverse prognostic factors of recurrent carcinomas. Local excision and partial penectomy were not adequate procedures for sarcomatoid and basaloid penile carcinomas. Carcinomas of foreskin had a better prognosis. Conversion from low to high-grade carcinoma was related to significant mortality. The identification of the adverse prognostic factors found in this study should be the base for an aggressive initial therapy to prevent recurrence in a subset of penile cancers. Re-excision of the recurrent tumor permitted the control of the disease only in one-third of the patients.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To prospectively assess the outcome of patients treated according to the European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines on the management of penile cancer, a system originally based on retrospective series. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2002 and 2005, 100 consecutive patients (median age 62 years) with penile cancer were treated at one institution; all were categorized and treated according to EAU guidelines. Data were analysed using the z-test, with significance defined as P < 0.05. RESULTS: Survival curves were limited to those with >12 months of follow-up (mean 29); the survival of the whole group was 92\%. Of men with palpable nodes, 72\% had lymph node involvement, whereas 18\% of those with impalpable nodes who had lymphadenectomy according to the guidelines had lymph node disease. The grade of the primary tumour was more predictive than T stage for lymph node involvement and survival. The 3-year disease-specific survival for N0, N1 and N2 disease was 100\%, 100\% and 73\%, respectively, and survival at 12 months for N3 disease was 67\%. The median survival for those with metastases was 3 months. CONCLUSION: The overall survival of men with penile cancer is high, with a clear benefit for early lymphadenectomy in men with positive nodal disease. However, the current EAU guidelines are limited in predicting those patients with micrometastatic disease, with the result that 82\% of patients undergo unnecessary prophylactic lymphadenectomy. There is a need to identify more accurate molecular markers for predicting lymph node disease, or the role of novel staging techniques must be assessed.},

Methods: The clinical and pathologic data of 175 patients who had undergone surgery for squamous cell carcinoma of the penis from 1980 to 2002 at 11 urologic centers of northeastern Italy were retrospectively collected. Results: According to the EAU risk group, 25 patients were categorized as at low (15.1\%), 23 (13.9\%) as intermediate, and 118 (71.1\%) as high risk of lymph node metastasis. Similarly, using the criteria of the Solsona risk group stratification, 25 (15.1\%), 55 (33.1\%), and 86 patients (51.8\%) were categorized as at low, intermediate, and high risk. At the median follow-up of 26 months, lymph node involvement was observed in 71 (40.6\%) of 175 patients. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that both the EAU risk group (area under the curve = 0.632) and Solsona risk group (area under the curve = 0.697) had a low accuracy for predicting lymph node involvement. Both risk groups were independent predictors of lymph node involvement, as well as the clinical stage of lymph node involvement and the presence of vascular and/or lymphatic embolization. Conclusions: The Solsona and EAU risk groups were both independent predictors of lymph node involvement, although the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that both risk groups had low predictive accuracy. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Penile squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) invading to a depth inferior to 5 mm usually have very low risk for regional metastasis, whereas tumors thicker than 10 mm have a high metastatic potential. A significant number of squamous cell carcinomas, however, belong to an intermediate category (5 to 10 mm in thickness) in which the incidence of regional lymph node metastasis is very difficult to predict. Consequently, a frequent clinical dilemma is whether to perform or not inguinal dissection in this group of lesions. The objective of this study was to evaluate multiple risk factors for regional metastasis in tumors 5 to 10-mm thick. One hundred thirty-four partial penectomies with invasive carcinomas 5 to 10-mm thick, all of which with corresponding inguinal lymph node dissection, were evaluated. Factors evaluated were--patient's age, anatomic site, histologic grade, tumor thickness, anatomic levels of invasion, and vascular and perineural invasion. Grades were classified as 1, well; 2, moderately; and 3, poorly differentiated. To evaluate independent significance of various prognostic factors, a logistic regression analysis was performed, and a nomogram was prepared to evaluate metastatic risk according to histologic grade and perineural invasion. Groin metastasis was found in 66 of 134 patients (49\%). High histologic grade and perineural invasion were statistically significant pathologic factors associated with groin metastasis. Nodal metastases were found in 2 of 25 grade 1 (8\%), 24 of 46 grade 2 (52\%), and 40 of 63 grade 3 carcinomas (63\%) (P value 0.0001). Of 48 patients with perineural invasion, metastasis was found in 33 cases (69\%) (P value 0.001). The average tumor thickness, anatomic level of invasion, and presence of vascular invasion were not statistically significantly different in metastasizing and nonmetastasizing neoplasms. Fifty percent of tumors invading 5 to 10 mm were not associated with metastasis and may be spared a nodal dissection. In this subset of patients, high histologic grade and perineural invasion were significant and useful risk factors associated with regional metastasis. The probability of inguinal node metastasis in patients with grade 1 tumors without perineural invasion is almost nonexistent whereas for high-grade tumors associated with perineural invasion is near 80\%.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: Penile cancer has high mortality once metastatic spread has occurred. Local treatment can be mutilating and devastating for the patient. Progress has been made in organ-preserving local treatment, lymph node management, and multimodal treatment of lymphatic metastases, requiring an update of the European Association of Urology guidelines. OBJECTIVE: To provide an evidence-based update of treatment recommendations based on the literature published since 2008. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A PubMed search covering the period from August 2008 to November 2013 was performed, and 352 full-text papers were reviewed. Levels of evidence were assessed and recommendations graded. Because there is a lack of controlled trials or large series, the levels of evidence and grades of recommendation are low compared with those for more common diseases. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Penile squamous cell carcinoma occurs in distinct histologic variants, some of which are related to human papilloma virus infection; others are not. Primary local treatment should be organ preserving, if possible. There are no outcome differences between local treatment modes in superficial and T1 disease. Management of inguinal lymph nodes is crucial for prognosis. In impalpable nodes, invasive staging should be done depending on the risk factors of the primary tumour. Lymph node metastases should be treated by surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy in N2/N3 disease. CONCLUSIONS: Organ preservation has become the standard approach to low-stage penile cancer, whereas in lymphatic disease, it is recognised that multimodal treatment with radical inguinal node surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy improves outcome. PATIENT SUMMARY: Approximately 80\% of penile cancer patients of all stages can be cured. With increasing experience in the management of penile cancer, it is recognized that organ-preserving treatment allows for better quality of life and sexual function and should be offered to all patients whenever feasible. Referral to centres with experience is recommended.},

abstract = {Purpose: The TNM classification is the most common tool for staging malignancies. The current classification for penile carcinoma has been unchanged since 1987. There are several shortcomings to this classification. Accurate clinical staging can be troublesome because several categories are defined by anatomical structures that cannot readily be identified by physical examination or imaging. A second drawback is substantial variability with respect to survival in certain T and N categories. We analyzed the prognostic value of the TNM classification in patients with penile carcinoma treated at our institute. We propose modifications to improve prognostic stratification and facilitate clinical staging. Materials and Methods: The records of 513 patients treated between 1956 and 2006 were analyzed. All tumors were staged according to the most recent classification. We calculated disease specific survival in the different T and N categories. Survival in the different categories was compared using Kaplan-Meier analysis and the log rank test. Results: Five-year disease specific survival in the entire group was 80.5\% at a median followup of 58.7 months. There was no significant difference in survival between T2 and T3 tumors (p = 0.57). Furthermore, no significant survival difference was found between N1 and N2 categories (p = 0.18). Using a modified classification a significant difference in survival was found among all T and N categories. Conclusions: The current TNM classification for penile carcinoma does not adequately differentiate in terms of survival among several T and N categories. With some modifications prognostic stratification improves and clinical staging is facilitated. ?? 2008 American Urological Association.},

abstract = {Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the penis is an uncommon disease in the US and Europe. Without treatment, patients with penile SCC usually die within 2 years after diagnosis of the primary lesion, because of uncontrollable locoregional disease or from distant metastases. The spread of the tumor to the locoregional lymph nodes (lymph-node positivity) is the most relevant prognostic factor. With the available treatments, 5-year cancer-specific survival probabilities are between 75\% and 93\% for those patients with clinically node-negative disease, and progressively lower for those with increasingly extensive node-positive disease. Similarly, patients with pathologically proven negative nodes have 5-year cancer-specific survival probabilities ranging from 85\% to 100\%. While patients with a single positive superficial lymph node on pathology have very good cancer-related outcomes, patients with multiple involved lymph nodes have significantly less favorable outcomes. This article focuses on the most important issues that surround the prognosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the penis, with special attention to the prognostic nomograms for penile cancer patients published in 2006.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate dynamic sentinel lymph node biopsy (DSLNB) in patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the penis and palpable inguinal lymph nodes, using inguinal lymph node dissection (ILND) as the reference standard to assess the reliability of DSLNB, as using radioscintigraphy and colloidal blue-dye injection to locate the SLN was reported to be a useful technique to avoid ILND in men with SCC of the penis and clinically impalpable nodes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 23 consecutive men with SCC of the penis and clinically palpable inguinal nodes treated between August 1999 and July 2006. On the day before surgery the patient had the SLN located by subcutaneous injection of 60 MBq (99m)Tc-nanocolloid 2 cm proximal to the penile tumour. The following day the patient was taken to the operating room for DSLNB, resection of the penile tumour and simultaneous ILND, if considered indicated (G2-3 and/or T3-4 primary tumour). During surgery 2 mL of colloidal blue dye was injected in the same area as the previous (99m)Tc-nanocolloid injection. The SLNs were located during surgery using a gamma-probe and visualization of blue dye in the node(s), which were then surgically removed. After partial or total penectomy, selected patients had ILND through a 10-cm subinguinal incision. The primary tumour, SLNs and ILND specimens were assessed histopathologically, using haematoxylin and eosin staining only. RESULTS: Biopsy of the primary tumour showed SCC grade 1 in six, grade 2 in 13 and grade 3 in two patients. The clinical T stage was T1 in two, T2 in seven, T3 in 13 and T4 in one. There were clinically palpable inguinal lymph nodes bilaterally in 19 and unilaterally in four men. Scintigraphy before surgery showed inguinal nodes bilaterally in 12 and unilaterally in eight patients, while there were no nodes in three. Surgery comprised partial penectomy in 14, radical penectomy in eight and circumcision alone in one patient. Simultaneous bilateral ILND was done in 15 patients. Inguinal node metastases were present in four of the 23 (17\%) patients; the SLN was falsely negative in three (13\%), one of whom had a small focus of cancer in the SLN that was missed on initial histopathological examination, and in two the dynamically located SLN contained no cancer, but node metastases were found in the ILND specimen. CONCLUSION: The relatively high false-negative rate of DSLNB indicates that it is not sufficiently reliable to replace complete ILND in men with a high suspicion of nodal metastases, i.e. a high-grade or high-stage primary lesion with clinically palpable inguinal nodes.},

abstract = {Objectives: In penile carcinoma, the most reliable staging method for lymph node involvement remains radical dissection with its associated high morbidity. However, the patient's prognosis is closely associated with lymph node status, and radical dissection is potentially curative. We report our experience with surgical lymph node staging and evaluate which group of patients could be assigned to a wait-and-see strategy or dynamic sentinel node biopsy and which group should undergo groin dissection. Methods: From 1979 to 2004, 56 consecutive patients with penile cancer underwent surgical inguinal lymph node staging. On the basis of the histopathologic results, we defined risk stratification into low, high, and intermediate-risk groups according to the clinical examination findings, stage, and grade. Results: Tumor stage (P = 0.019) and tumor grade (P <0.001) correlated significantly with lymph node status. Stratification into low (pT1G1, pT1G2), high (all G3 tumors), and intermediate-risk (all others) groups found 7.7\% of low-risk patients with metastases. In the intermediate and high-risk groups, 28.6\% and 75.0\% had nodal metastases, respectively. Correlation with nodal involvement according to risk group was R2 = 0.608 (P <0.001). Conclusions: Risk stratification might enable a modified staging strategy for lymph node status according to stage, grade, and clinical examination findings. Highly motivated low-risk patients could be included in a surveillance program; however, high-risk patients should undergo bilateral inguinal dissection. Dynamic sentinel lymph node biopsy might be encouraged for intermediate-risk patients in the future. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This review describes the morbidity of inguinal lymph node dissection (ILND) performed as part of the management of penile cancer as well as recent modifications that may reduce the incidence of complications. METHODS: A review of the literature was conducted using Pubmed for studies reporting complication outcomes of ILND for penile cancer. Furthermore, our contemporary results and patient related morbidity associated with ILND performed for penile cancer are reported and compared with prior series. RESULTS: A review of the literature over the past 25 years identified 27 manuscripts discussing complications of ILND in the context of penile cancer. ILND has traditionally been associated with an 80-100\% risk of surgical morbidity, with skin necrosis, wound dehiscence, infection, and lymphedema the predominant findings. Recent technical modifications and management strategies have reduced the associated risks of this surgical procedure. Most recently, we report a 19 and 27\% rate of minor and major complications, respectively, for a diagnostic ILND (i.e., superficial ILND alone in the absence of nodal metastasis) and a 29 and 24\% rate of minor and major complications, respectively, for a therapeutic ILND (superficial/deep ILND and pelvic lymph node dissection in the presence of nodal metastasis). In contrast, among clinically node negative patients undergoing dynamic sentinel lymph node biopsy as a staging procedure, the reported complication rate was 7\%. CONCLUSIONS: The incorporation of novel management strategies and surgical modifications have resulted in decreasing peri-operative morbidity associated with inguinal staging and therapy.},

Our aim is to highlight the development of this novel technique, which offers a possible option for a less morbid surgical approach. METHOD: Review of the available medical literature in ELPC. RESULTS: Regional surgical therapy constitutes a mainstay element of therapeutics for penile carcinoma. Elevated morbidity remains an issue for the traditional surgical approach. Endoscopic lymphadenectomy for penile carcinoma emerged as surgical option to accomplish cancer objectives while avoiding substantial morbidity. CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic approach for inguinal lymphadenectomy in penile carcinoma is still in a developing stage in which it is mandatory to evaluate larger series of patients with longer follow-up.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves are useful tools to evaluate classifiers in biomedical and bioinformatics applications. However, conclusions are often reached through inconsistent use or insufficient statistical analysis. To support researchers in their ROC curves analysis we developed pROC, a package for R and S+ that contains a set of tools displaying, analyzing, smoothing and comparing ROC curves in a user-friendly, object-oriented and flexible interface.

RESULTS: With data previously imported into the R or S+ environment, the pROC package builds ROC curves and includes functions for computing confidence intervals, statistical tests for comparing total or partial area under the curve or the operating points of different classifiers, and methods for smoothing ROC curves. Intermediary and final results are visualised in user-friendly interfaces. A case study based on published clinical and biomarker data shows how to perform a typical ROC analysis with pROC.

CONCLUSIONS: pROC is a package for R and S+ specifically dedicated to ROC analysis. It proposes multiple statistical tests to compare ROC curves, and in particular partial areas under the curve, allowing proper ROC interpretation. pROC is available in two versions: in the R programming language or with a graphical user interface in the S+ statistical software. It is accessible at http://expasy.org/tools/pROC/ under the GNU General Public License. It is also distributed through the CRAN and CSAN public repositories, facilitating its installation.},
